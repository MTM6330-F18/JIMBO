          <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: sans-serif; margin-top: 25px;">
            Motion graphics, typography, special effects, and animation are used in the industry to market and sell
            products and services. Students enhance existing video footage and create brand- or product-based animation
            sequences through industry-standard motion graphics software packages. Students work with multiple forms of
            media, syncing together audio, video, transitions and added effects to create professional quality video.
            (In order to study this course, you will be required MTM6200 Video Foundations)<br /><br />Furthermore,
            Motion graphics are pieces of digital footage animation which create the illusion of motion or
            rotation, and are usually combined with audio for use in multimedia projects. Motion graphics are usually
            displayed via electronic media technology, but may also be displayed via manual powered technology (e.g.
            thaumatrope, phenakistoscope, stroboscope, zoetrope, praxinoscope, flip book). The term distinguishes still
            graphics from those with a transforming appearance over time, without over-specifying the form. While any
            form of experimental or abstract animation can be called motion graphics, the term typically more
            explicitly refers to the commercial application of animation and effects to video, film, TV, and
            interactive applications.

          <h3 style="margin-top: 45px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Server-Side Development</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: sans-serif; margin-top: 25px;">Having static content works well if
            your website only has a few pages. However, today's modern sites
            frequently have thousands of pages. Building on the importance of dynamic websites learned through their
            experiences with Content Management Systems, students leverage databases to store and output content and
            change websites content and interface elements based on user interactions. The focus is on creating dynamic
            data and APIs to be used with responsive websites.<br />
            In the modern world of web development, learning about server-side development is highly recommended.
            Most major websites use some kind of server-side technology to dynamically display different data as
            required. For example, imagine how many products are available on Amazon, and imagine how many posts have
            been written on Facebook? Displaying all of these using completely different static pages would be
            completely inefficient, so instead such sites display static templates (built using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript), and then dynamically update the data displayed inside those templates when needed, e.g. when
            you want to view a different product on Amazon.

            Micheal Eisenbraun has been teaching at Algonquin College in the IMD program for 3 years. Currently, I
            teach Client Side Web Development and Server Side Web Development. I prefer Client Side Web Development,
            because of the excitement and potential JavaScript brings to modern web development.
            Micheal Eisenbraun created my first website in 1997, and over the past 20 years, web development and design
            has remained a hobby. I am mostly self-taught with very little formal training, and I have over 10 years of
            professional experience. However, my focus, currently, is on teaching.
            <br />The field of web design and development is ever-changing and if you donâ€™t keep moving, you will fall
            behind. It is this realization that lead me to start teaching at Algonquin College in January of 2016. I
            have a passion for learning and it fuels my desire to share what I know with others.

          <h3 style="margin-top: 45px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Project Management</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: sans-serif; margin-top: 25px;">Effective management of time,
            resources, clients, and teams is crucial to the success of any project. Students learn the theory of
            project management, following industry standard guidelines and best practices. The full project cycle is
            explored, including planning, managing risks, intellectual property rights, client and team communication,
            project scope, project documentation and closure.
            Leadership
            If weâ€™ve learned anything from years of leading projects, itâ€™s that great leadership is an essential skill
            to being a good project manager. Our leadership role means we lead and manage teams; setting the vision,
            motivating the team, serving them, coaching them and inspiring others.
            Communication
            One of the essential skills for project management is the ability to communicate well â€“ understanding and
            being understood. Great communication is the crux of any relationship and so the effectiveness of a project
            managerâ€™s communication has an impact not only on the project team but the client and stakeholders too.
            Time Management
            As project managers, a huge part of our job is determining and communicating how other people will spend
            their time. But itâ€™s equally important to be aware of how we are manage our own time.
            Risk Management
            Project managers are always an easy target when projects donâ€™t go to plan. Regardless of the circumstances,
            everyone wonders whether the project manager could have foreseen and prevented the risk before it became an
            issue.
            Negotiation Skills
            Project management is somewhat like politics; it often brings together a disparate group of people, often
            with competing interests, and our job is to get these different interests on the same page, so that we can
            accomplish project goals. In other words, a good project manager must be an excellent negotiator.

            Adam Jarvis: I presume this is related to me being employed. In that case, I started as a PA in September
            of 2008 with IMD (and also my first position at Algonquin), then began teaching in January of 2009, in IMD
            but also in Journalism. I taught at Algonquin until the winter semester of 2016, then took a break and
            explored other things for a few years, and finally returned to teaching in this semester.
            I have taught many courses across many different programs (including IMD, IMM - the one year program,
            Journalism, and others). I've attached a full course list for your interest, but most probably isn't
            relevant to what you are doing. Typically I teach in courses that have some sort of coding element, but not
            always. My favourites have definitely been the HTML and Javascript courses. I enjoy coding and find
            teaching it to be quite fun as well.

          <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: sans-serif; margin-top: 25px;">
            students are provided an opportunity to work with real clients or on industry-reflective projects, using
            their skills to build real-world applications and multimedia products. Working in teams, students plan,
            manage and develop a project through the full project cycle, from proposal to post-mortem, while developing
            teamwork skills and using the techniques and best practices acquired through the Project Management Skills
            class. Students are expected to make a presentation of final project work.

            Just in case anyone missed the memo below from Sherryl Fraser Chair of Design Studies I am posting it
            below. And I would like to remind everyone that 3 yellow marks on the sign in sheet is equal to a grade
            point
            reduction off your final 3rd semester mark.
            <br /><br />Good Afternoon,
            <br /><br />Please see the note below from Design Studies Chair, Sherryl Fraser:
            As we approach week 10, I have been made aware that attendance in Kenâ€™s classâ€™ is often sporadic. It is
            vital that you attend class and stay until the end. This allows you to use the class time to work on your
            projects and confer with your classmates in class and receive feedback from your professor rather than
            finding time outside class. As a reminder, if you are not present you are losing participation marks as you
            are not taking part in the discussions and progress of your assignment.
          </p>
