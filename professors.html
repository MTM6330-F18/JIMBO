                      IMD?</strong
                    ><br />I started as a PA in September of 2008 with IMD (and
                    also my first position at Algonquin), then began teaching in
                    January of 2009, in IMD but also in Journalism. I taught at
                    Algonquin until the winter semester of 2016, then took a
                    break and explored other things for a few years, and finally
                    returned to teaching in this semester.<br /><br />

                    ><br /> 
                    I have taught many courses across many different programs
                    (including IMD, IMM - the one year program, Journalism, and
                    others). Typically I teach in courses that have some sort of
                    coding element, but not always. My favourites have
                    definitely been the HTML and Javascript courses. I enjoy
                    coding and find teaching it to be quite fun as well.<br /><br />

                      >What is your background in related schooling and
                      industry? Are you currently employed in it?</strong
                    >
                    <br />
                    I have a bachelor's from Carleton in Film Studies (which is
                    sort of related), and took IMD from 2005-2007. As of this
                    December I will also have a master's in education from UOIT.
                    I have been employed in the industry at various points in
                    time, though my last job (the one I just left) was only sort
                    of related. I am currently pursuing a nearly completely
                    unrelated opportunity and am not employed in the industry.
                    My last directly related job was as the chief creative
                    officer of a start-up from September of 2015 to September of
                    2016. <br /><br />
                    <strong>Why did you come to Algonquin?</strong><br />
                    Because I needed a job? Actually, the company that I first
                    worked at after graduating from IMD (I was doing 3D digital
                    architecture, and was also the webmaster for a bit - it was
                    a small company) was collapsing due to mismanagement and I
                    happened to have a friend teaching in IMD who told me they
                    might have an opening. I honestly could not have said before
                    I started that I could see myself becoming a teacher. But,
                    now that I am, I do quite enjoy it.<br /><br />

                      >Do you have some advice for prospective IMD
                      students?</strong
                    ><br />
                    IMD is a tough program, but you get out of it what you put
                    into it. Work hard, stay on top of assignments, and above
                    all, make sure you enjoy the work that you do.<br /><br />
                    <strong

                      about?</strong
                    ><br />
                    This course is designed to run in parallel with the Applied
                    Projects course. We teach skills necessary for running a
                    successful multimedia project, then students apply them in
                    the projects they do for the applied projects course. There
                    is definitely some overlap between the two courses in terms
                    of material covered.<br /><br />

                    Expect, on average, to have a two-hour class and a couple of
                    hours of homework each week.<br /><br />

                    ><br />
                    You need a pen. It sounds odd, but we do a lot of
                    brainstorming and sketching activities. It's good to have a
                    general knowledge of multimedia skills and be aware of how a
                    multimedia project would proceed, which is why this course
                    is run after students have a year experience in the
                    program.<br /><br />

                    ><br />
                    Project Management is a key skillset that most, if not all,
                    employers are looking for. It is absolutely necessary if you
                    want to advance in this industry, and vital for doing any
                    kind of freelance work. Getting used to the process now
                    makes it that much easier when you have to do it in the real
                    world.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Why do you personally like this course?</strong
                    ><br />
                    I like the survey nature of the course, that we cover a lot
                    of material without digging too much in depth into any one
                    area. This gives students a strong base they can build from.
                    I also like the parallel nature of this course to Applied
                    Projects.<br /><br />

                      IMD?</strong

                    ><br />
                    My most favorite one was motion graphics project lab because
                    it’s a very big course and there’s a lot of one-on-one, and
                    results towards the end are very good, unfortunately we do
                    not offer this course anymore but it was my ultimate
                    favorite one. I teach motion graphics at varying levels,
                    content management systems, design, video, project
                    management, digital publishing, multimedia, web and applied
                    projects.<br /><br />

                    <br />
                    Well, I’ve been working since I was 15 in my field. I worked
                    in media in the middle-east. The company I worked at was
                    multi-national and I was in a technical support team as
                    supervisor. I’ve also been doing freelancing since 2008. I
                    worked for a company called Winden Media, but now I’m on
                    contract with them. I did digital signage. I’ve been
                    teaching for 8 or 9 years now. I also started my business
                    about a year ago, in automotive.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Why did you come to Algonquin?</strong><br />
                    It’s actually interesting – I came to Canada to visit my
                    brother, who was taking an advanced diploma in electrical
                    engineering. He asked if I wanted to see where he went to
                    school, I came here, I liked everything, and decided to take
                    a different path. That’s why I took the IMD program, and I
                    had the chance to become an assistant and teacher.<br /><br />
                    <strong
                      >Do you have some advice for prospective IMD
                      students?</strong
                    ><br />
                    Niche. Learn everything then find your niche. You can’t
                    promote yourself as a master of everything. You still need
                    to know about multiple areas; if you’re a graphic designer
                    you still need to have some skills in video and photography
                    and other things, but you really need your niche to say that
                    you can do one, two, three.<br /><br />
                    <strong>What is your course (Motion Graphics) about?</strong
                    ><br />
                    Well motion graphics, it hits a very booming area which is
                    motion design. It is everywhere. It didn’t used to be, but
                    now it is. I’m talking about tv, about web, about things you
                    see on your phone. It is everywhere. You go to the
                    restaurant, there are screens with motion graphics. The
                    doctor’s office, the airport, everywhere you go, you see
                    motion design, and it has a strong connection to digital
                    signage which is everywhere now, so by acquiring these
                    skills needed in the motion design world, you’ll be able to
                    tackle a lot of different projects.<br /><br />
                    <strong
                      >How much time per week should one devote to this
                      course?</strong
                    ><br />
                    This is my ultimate rule: the way I see it always is three hours here, 
                    three hours at home, two hours here, two hours at home, every week. 
                    That’s the way it should be because one, you will basically go over all 
                    you had in the week and you will have no questions, and two, you will 
                    prepare for the next week so it isn’t fresh information for you.<br /><br />

                      >What skillset and equipment should students have before
                      taking this course?</strong
                    ><br />
                    A little bit of knowledge about Adobe, because this is Aftereffects. 
                    Some computer skills, organizing things, because you will really be 
                    importing a lot of files. If you don’t organize them the right way, 
                    it won’t be good. One last thing is that you need a good computer. 
                    Aftereffects requires a lot of resources.<br /><br />
                    <strong
                      >What are the future benefits of taking this
                      course?</strong
                    ><br />
                    It’ll help you in digital signage, motion design, and graphic 
                    design because even graphics designers don’t just design for 
                    print anymore. There are tablets, phones, computers. You really 
                    need some motion design skills.</strong
                    ><br />
                    I like it because it is creative, there’s a lot of creativity here. 
                    It isn’t 1+1=2. You learn how to do things, but you’ll find yourself 
                    always imagining how an animation can work and how you can make it happen. 
                    What you’re doing is something that doesn’t exist yet. If you’re not creative, 
                    you won’t be able to do it.<br /><br />
